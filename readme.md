# GeoJSON & TopoJSON collection of UK boundary data

This archive contains both GeoJSON and TopoJSON files of data for UK boundaries, ideal for creating choropleth maps of UK areas.

All data is converted from the generalised clipped boundaries provided by the Office of National Statistics and Ordnance Survey. Data has been converted to GeoJSON from original shapefiles using ogr2ogr, then converted to TopoJSON using topojson. 

Data is organised according to the geographical hierarchy to which it belongs (see below), then by area of the UK covered.
